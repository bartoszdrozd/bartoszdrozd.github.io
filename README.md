# Simple static website made using Frozen-flask
This is an alpha version of my static website made using these technologies:
- Flask framework
- Frozen-flask -> module used to generate static files based on a Flask app
- Bootstrap
- check requirements.txt for installed packages

To fix:
- favicon
- mail sending 

To do:
- decide how the static site should look like compared to the dynamic one
- create tests to check basic funcionalities and requests (eg. mapbox request ... )
- work a bit on the frontend side (maybe create static files from scratch)
- improve the building and deployment mechanisms
- add a map with ISS current location and ground tracks calculated from TLEs
