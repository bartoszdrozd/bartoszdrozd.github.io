# Simple static website made using Frozen-flask
This is an alpha version of my static website made using these technologies:
- Flask framework
- Frozen-flask -> module used to generate static files based on a Flask app
- elsa -> Helper module for hosting Frozen-Flask based websites on GitHub pages (https://github.com/pyvec/elsa), this still needs to be fixed 
- Bootstrap
- check requirements.txt for installed packages
